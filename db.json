      "description": "By HT Sports Desk MS Dhoni is well known for his accuracy in getting umpire's on-field calls reviewed by the Decision Review System. A DRS call can turn the match on its head, imagine getting a dismissal in one's favour or having one overturned by DRS. Such timely and perfect calls by a team's captain, have proven to be the gamechanger on many occasions in a cricket match. Such is the former India captain's reading of the game and moments in the match that cricket fans have started calling DRS as Dhoni Review System.",

In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.",
